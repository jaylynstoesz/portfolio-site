      description: "TweetHelper is a web app in which users can input the URL to any article page to view keywords from that article as hashtags. The user can then compose a custom tagged and linked Tweet for that article and post directly from the app. From there, the app builds a brand profile for the user as they post articles from the app. The most interesting parts of this project were learning to boil down page content to get keywords, as well as incorporating Twitter. As a marketing nerd, I loved discovering basic patterns in the content that drive contextual advertising on other, much larger platforms.",

      description: "Monopolize is a Galvanize-themed Monopoly game, complete with ping-pong utilities and a faulty elevator as the jail (yes, people actually get stuck in the elevator at the Galvanize Platte campus). This project was quite challenging, and got increasingly complex as we added the features that make Monopoly the game we all know and love. My role was primarily front-end, as I worked on all DOM manipulation and CSS styling to create the working game board, dynamic player dashboard, and moving pieces.",

      description: "This app is a road trip planner that allows users to create new trip, find things to do along the way, and blog about their experiences. The user can log in and create a new trip using a Google Maps API, which then directs them to a trip dashboard. From here, they can add and remove destinations along the way; find activities, restaurants, and lodging; and locate the nearest gas station - all using various Google Maps API's. They can also create blog posts about their trip, and click a button to indicate when their trip is complete. On the user dashboard, the user can see displays for each of the trips they have created within the app, see how many miles they have traveled, and fill out their profile with their name and hometown. I took part in every aspect of this project, but for me, the most interesting part was exploring React JS.",
