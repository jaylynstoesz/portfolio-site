      description: "Monopolize is a twist on Monopoly with a Galvanize theme. Building the game was challenging, and we had a lot of fun building learning along the way. Four players are able to play and choose their tokens at the beginning. They are then prompted with choices after they roll the die. The player dashboard allows all players to see each others deeds and current balance. The winner is the last player standing, if you make it through a whole game. My role was primarily front-end, as I worked on all DOM manipulation and CSS styling.",

The user can log in and create a new trip using a Google Maps API, which then directs them to a trip dashboard. From here, they can add and remove destinations along the way; find activities, restaurants, and lodging; and locate the nearest gas station - all using various Google Maps API's. They can also create blog posts about their trip, and click a button to indicate when their trip is complete. On the user dashboard, the user can see displays for each of the trips they have created within the app, see how many miles they have traveled, and fill out their profile with their name and hometown.",
